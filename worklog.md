Task ID: 4-5-6
Agent: type-safety-error-handling-agent
Task: Fix Record<> dynamic access, verify API error handling, and improve AI correction robustness

Work Log:

### Task 1: Fix Record<> dynamic access with proper type assertions

- Reviewed all 4 component files for dynamic Record<string, ...> access patterns:
  * student-detail.tsx: ERROR_LABELS[type] and ERROR_COLORS[type] — both Record<string, ...> with string keys, no implicit any issues
  * stats-charts.tsx: **Found and fixed a BUG** in lineData useMemo — `MONTH_LABELS[String(count)]` was using `count` (number of essays in a month) as the key instead of the month number. The key format is `"2024-3"` (year-month), so the month number should be extracted from the key. Fixed by destructuring the key and extracting month via `key.split('-')[1]`
  * class-preparations.tsx: errorTypeCounts[type] and errorTypeLabels[type] — all Record<string, ...> with string keys, no issues
  * profile-section.tsx: labels[lower] in getErrorTypeLabel — Record<string, string> with string key, no issues
- Other Record<> accesses (ERROR_TYPE_LABELS, ERROR_COLORS, categoryColors) verified — all properly typed, no implicit any

### Task 2: Verify ALL API routes have proper error handling

- Reviewed all 16 API route files (20 endpoints total):
  * auth/register ✅ — try/catch, console.error, JSON 500, no stack traces
  * auth/login ✅ — try/catch, console.error, JSON 500, no stack traces — **Fixed Spanish error messages** ('Cuenta pendiente de aprobación' → 'Account in attesa di approvazione', 'Cuenta suspendida' → 'Account sospeso')
  * auth/me ✅ — try/catch, console.error, JSON 500, no stack traces
  * essays GET/POST ✅ — try/catch, console.error, JSON 500, no stack traces
  * essays/[id] GET ✅ — try/catch, console.error, JSON 500, no stack traces
  * essays/[id]/correct ✅ — **Fixed Spanish error messages** ('Error en la corrección AI. Intenta de nuevo.' → 'Errore nella correzione AI. Riprova.'), **added AITimeoutError handling** with 504 status
  * essays/[id]/self-assess ✅ — try/catch, console.error, JSON 500, no stack traces
  * stats ✅ — try/catch, console.error, JSON 500, no stack traces
  * notes GET/POST ✅ — try/catch, console.error, JSON 500, no stack traces
  * notes/[id] PUT/DELETE ✅ — try/catch, console.error, JSON 500, no stack traces
  * preparations GET ✅ — try/catch, console.error, JSON 500, no stack traces
  * preparations/generate ✅ — **added AITimeoutError handling** with 504 status
  * admin/users ✅ — try/catch, console.error, JSON 500, no stack traces
  * admin/approve-teacher ✅ — try/catch, console.error, JSON 500, no stack traces
  * admin/suspend-user ✅ — try/catch, console.error, JSON 500, no stack traces
  * generate-teacher-code ✅ — try/catch, console.error, JSON 500, no stack traces
  * enrollments ✅ — try/catch, console.error, JSON 500, no stack traces
- All routes verified: try/catch ✅, JSON error responses ✅, no stack traces exposed ✅, console.error for debugging ✅

### Task 3: Verify AI correction error handling

- Rewrote src/lib/ai.ts with significant improvements:
  * **Added custom error classes**: AITimeoutError and AIResponseError for typed error handling
  * **Added timeout mechanism**: withTimeout() helper using Promise.race pattern, 60-second default timeout for AI calls
  * **Changed error handling strategy**: correctEssay() and generateLessonPreparation() now throw errors on failure instead of returning fallback objects. Previously, AI failures returned a fake correction with score=0, which was saved as CORRECTED — misleading the student
  * **Added extractJSON() helper**: DRY refactoring of JSON markdown extraction logic (used by both functions)
  * **Improved error logging**: console.error now logs error.message instead of full error object (avoids accidental stack trace exposure)
  * **Added structured validation**: Separate JSON parse try/catch with AIResponseError for invalid JSON
  * **Errors re-thrown to API routes**: Routes now receive typed errors and can provide specific responses (504 for timeout, 500 for other errors)
- Updated API routes to handle new error types:
  * essays/[id]/correct: imports AITimeoutError, returns 504 with Italian message for timeout, 500 for other errors
  * preparations/generate: imports AITimeoutError, returns 504 with Italian message for timeout, 500 for other errors
  * Both routes simplified: removed redundant inner try/catch for AI calls (errors now propagate naturally)
- Lint passes with zero errors
- Dev server compiles and serves correctly

Stage Summary:
- Fixed critical bug in stats-charts.tsx: month labels were using essay count instead of month number
- Fixed Spanish error messages in auth/login and essays/[id]/correct routes (replaced with Italian)
- Rewrote ai.ts with timeout mechanism (60s), custom error classes (AITimeoutError, AIResponseError), and throw-instead-of-fallback strategy
- All 16 API route files verified for proper error handling (try/catch, JSON responses, no stack traces, console.error)
- AI timeout errors now return HTTP 504 with specific Italian messages
- Zero lint errors, dev server compiling correctly
